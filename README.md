Mobile Social Networking app made with React Native. Cool thing about this one is, you can't see a person's profile pic until you've chatted with them for a while. 

Made this for my final year project. It uses JavaScript all around, in the server with Node.js/Express and Mongoose (ORM for MongoDB), and in the client with React Native (ES6).

My experience with React Native has been mostly positive. I was able to push out an almost finished app in 1 1/2 months that could easily be ported to iOS. 

There's been some quirks I've had to deal with, but honestly I'd use React Native again over native dev anytime. In fact, I plan on continuing this once Facebook do their <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/06/14/state-of-react-native-2018">React Native rewrite</a>.
